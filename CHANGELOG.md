and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.13.0] - 2026-04-10

Development since v3.12.3 focuses on quota visibility, provider workflow upgrades, stronger proxy compatibility, and lower-overhead tray / session workflows.

### Added

- **Lightweight Mode**: Added a tray-only mode that destroys the main window and keeps CC Switch running from the system tray, with the window recreated when users reopen it.
- **Provider Model Auto-Fetch**: Added OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` discovery for Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and OpenClaw provider forms, including grouped dropdown selection and failure-specific error messages.
- **Quota & Balance Visibility**: Added inline quota or balance display for official Claude / Codex / Gemini providers, GitHub Copilot premium interactions, Codex OAuth providers, Token Plan providers (Kimi / Zhipu GLM / MiniMax), and official balance queries for DeepSeek, StepFun, SiliconFlow, OpenRouter, and Novita AI. Copilot / ChatGPT OAuth and CLI subscription quota now only auto-poll for the currently active provider, preventing unnecessary API calls and misleading displays on non-current cards.
- **Skills Discovery & Batch Updates**: Added SHA-256 based skill update detection, per-skill and batch update actions, a storage-location toggle between CC Switch and `~/.agents/skills`, and public `skills.sh` search integration.
- **Session Workflow Upgrades**: Added batch delete in Session Manager, a directory picker before launching Claude terminal restore commands, usage import from Claude / Codex / Gemini session logs without requiring proxy interception, and per-app usage filtering for Claude / Codex / Gemini dashboards.
- **Codex OAuth Reverse Proxy**: Added ChatGPT Plus / Pro based Codex OAuth reverse proxy support for Claude provider cards, including managed OAuth login and inline subscription quota display.
- **OpenCode / OpenClaw Stream Check Coverage**: Added OpenCode npm package mapping plus support for OpenClaw `openai-completions` and the remaining OpenClaw protocol variants in Stream Check.
- **Full URL Endpoint Mode**: Added a provider option that treats `base_url` as a complete upstream endpoint so proxy forwarding and stream checks can work with vendors that require nonstandard URL layouts.
- **OpenCode StepFun Step Plan Preset**: Added a StepFun Step Plan provider preset for OpenCode.
- **Copilot Interaction Optimizer**: Added request classification and routing logic to reduce unnecessary GitHub Copilot premium interaction consumption.
- **First-Run Welcome Dialog**: Added a one-time welcome dialog on fresh installs explaining how existing configuration is preserved as a default provider and how the bundled official preset enables one-click revert. Upgrade users are excluded.
- **Official Provider Seeding**: Added automatic seeding of Claude Official, OpenAI Official, and Google Official provider entries on startup, giving every user a one-click path back to the official endpoint.
- **OpenCode / OpenClaw Auto-Import**: Added automatic startup import of live OpenCode and OpenClaw provider configurations, matching the auto-import behavior already present for Claude, Codex, and Gemini.
- **Common Config Editor Guidance**: Added an informational guide and empty-state prompt to the Common Config snippet editor modal for Claude, Codex, and Gemini, with i18n support.
- **Common Config First-Run Notice**: Added a one-time informational dialog explaining Common Config Snippets when users first open the provider add/edit form.
- **Claude Session Titles**: Added meaningful title extraction for Claude sessions using a priority chain: custom-title metadata, first real user message, then directory basename fallback.
- **Session Search Highlighting**: Added keyword highlighting in session titles and messages during Session Manager search.
- **URL-Based Provider Icons**: Added a dual rendering mode to the icon system supporting Vite URL imports for large SVGs and raster images (PNG, JPG, WebP), keeping small SVGs inlined.
- **Kaku Terminal Support**: Added Kaku as a selectable terminal for session launch on macOS, reusing the WezTerm-compatible launch path.
- **OMO Slim Council Support**: Restored first-class council support as a built-in oh-my-opencode-slim agent with updated metadata and UI copy.
- **TheRouter Provider Preset**: Added TheRouter provider presets across Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and OpenClaw.
- **DDSHub Provider Preset**: Added DDSHub as a third-party partner provider for Claude with icon and partner promotion text.
- **LionCCAPI Provider Preset**: Added LionCCAPI as a third-party partner provider across all five apps with anthropic-messages protocol for OpenCode and OpenClaw.
- **Shengsuanyun Provider Preset**: Added Shengsuanyun (胜算云) as an aggregator partner provider across all five apps with URL-based icon and localized display name.
- **PIPELLM Provider Preset**: Added PIPELLM provider preset across Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and OpenClaw with full model definitions and icon.
- **E-FlowCode Provider Preset**: Added E-FlowCode provider preset across all five apps with per-app protocol configuration.

### Changed

- **Tray Menu Organization**: Reworked the tray menu into per-app submenus to prevent overflow and make background provider switching scale better with larger provider lists.
- **Proxy Forwarding Stack**: Refactored proxy forwarding onto a Hyper-based client with transparent header forwarding, improved endpoint rewriting, and better support for dynamic upstream endpoints.
- **OAuth Auth Center UI Polish**: Tightened the Auth Center copy, layout, and icon presentation so the Codex OAuth login flow feels cleaner and less cluttered.
- **Provider Key Lifecycle & Live Sync**: Reworked additive provider create / rename / duplicate flows so live config writes, cleanup, and rollback stay consistent across OpenCode / OpenClaw and takeover scenarios.
- **Codex OAuth Defaults**: Updated the Codex OAuth preset to the GPT-5.4 model family.

### Fixed

- **Copilot Authentication & Proxy Compatibility**: Fixed GitHub Copilot authentication regressions, corrected enterprise / dynamic endpoint handling, repaired clipboard verification-code copying on macOS and Linux, and fixed Responses routing when Copilot-backed Claude providers target OpenAI models.
- **Streaming Parser Compatibility**: Fixed SSE parsing to accept fields with optional spaces, improving compatibility with non-strict streaming implementations.
- **UTF-8 Stream Chunk Boundaries**: Fixed intermittent garbled output (U+FFFD replacement characters) in Claude Code when multi-byte UTF-8 sequences such as Chinese characters or emoji were split across TCP stream chunks via the Copilot reverse proxy, by preserving incomplete trailing bytes across chunks in all four SSE streaming paths instead of lossy decoding.
- **Fragmented System Prompt Normalization**: Fixed strict OpenAI-compatible chat backends (Nvidia, Qwen-style) rejecting requests when converted Claude payloads contained multiple system messages, by merging system content into a single leading system message during the Anthropic → OpenAI chat transformation.
- **Provider Switch State Corruption**: Serialized per-app provider switches to prevent concurrent failover or hot-switch operations from leaving `is_current`, settings state, and live backup state out of sync.
- **Claude Takeover Live Config Drift**: Fixed provider edits while Claude takeover is active so live settings remain aligned with the latest provider state without breaking takeover restore behavior.
- **WebDAV Password Retention & Validation**: Fixed the WebDAV password field so saved credentials remain visible after refresh and treated `MKCOL 405` responses correctly during connection validation.
- **Provider Card Action States**: Fixed additive-mode highlight behavior, aligned usage display layout across provider cards, replaced hard proxy-switch blocking with a warning path, and disabled unsupported test / usage actions for Copilot and Codex OAuth cards.
- **Usage Accuracy & Pricing**: Fixed MiniMax quota math and 0%→100% progression, corrected CNY→USD pricing plus missing model definitions, improved Gemini session-log syncing, and resolved session-based usage entries being shown as unknown providers.
- **Usage Editor & Skills UI Regressions**: Fixed usage query fields being reset while editing extractor code, corrected broken `skills.sh` links and empty descriptions, and fixed auto-query defaults plus number-input clearing in usage configuration.
- **Chinese Skills Terminology**: Unified Skills-related labels across settings panels in the `zh` locale so storage and sync options use consistent wording.
- **Environment & Preset Compatibility**: Added Bun global bin detection in CLI scan, adapted to the oh-my-openagent rename with backward compatibility, corrected the OpenCode `kimi-for-coding` preset, gated Gemini keychain parsing to macOS, and fixed an OpenClaw serializer panic on empty collections.
- **Linux UI Unresponsive on Startup**: Fixed a bug where the window UI (including native title bar buttons) couldn't receive clicks on Linux until the user manually maximized and restored the window. Root causes: (1) Tauri webview did not acquire keyboard focus after `show()` on Linux, so the first click was consumed by X11/Wayland click-to-activate (Tauri #10746, wry #637); (2) GTK surface's input region failed to renegotiate on the `visible:false → show()` path under some WebKitGTK/compositor combinations, leaving the entire window unresponsive. Mitigations: set `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1` at startup, and added a new `linux_fix::nudge_main_window` helper that performs `set_focus` + a ±1px no-op resize ~200ms after show, equivalent to a visually invisible "maximize-and-restore". Wired into all window-re-show paths (normal startup, deeplink, single_instance, tray `show_main`, lightweight exit).
- **Linux Drag Region on Header**: Removed `data-tauri-drag-region` from the top header bar on Linux to avoid triggering `gtk_window_begin_move_drag` paths affected by Tauri #13440 under Wayland. macOS drag behavior is preserved.
- **OpenCode / OpenClaw Stream Check Edge Cases**: Fixed custom-header passthrough, OpenClaw custom auth-header detection, Bedrock error messaging, and OpenCode default `baseURL` fallback handling in Stream Check.
- **Duplicate Toast on Provider Switch**: Fixed double toast notifications (proxy-required warning followed by switch-success) when switching to Copilot, ChatGPT, or OpenAI-format providers with the proxy not running.
- **Session Search Accuracy & Chinese Support**: Fixed session search result truncation across providers and switched FlexSearch tokenizer to full mode for proper Chinese substring matching.
- **Adaptive Thinking Reasoning Effort**: Fixed `resolve_reasoning_effort()` mapping adaptive thinking to `xhigh` instead of incorrectly using `high` in OpenAI format conversions.
- **Thinking Model Fallback Display**: Fixed the Claude provider form showing an empty Thinking model field after saving only a main model by applying read-only fallback to ANTHROPIC_MODEL.
- **Auth Tab Localization**: Fixed missing i18n translation keys for the settings auth tab label across all locale bundles.
- **Schema Migration Guard**: Fixed database migrations failing when skills or model_pricing tables did not exist by adding table-existence checks before ALTER and UPDATE operations.

### Docs

- **User Manual Refresh**: Updated the EN / ZH / JA manuals for tray submenus, lightweight mode, provider model fetching, session management, workspace files, WebDAV v2 behavior, OpenCode / OpenClaw activation, and other provider workflow improvements.
- **Community & Contribution Docs**: Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, bilingual issue / PR templates, Dependabot config, and CI quality checks.
- **Release Notes Risk Notice**: Added a Copilot reverse proxy risk notice and anchored highlight links in the v3.12.3 release notes across all three languages.
- **Sponsor Partners**: Added Shengsuanyun, LionCC, and DDS as sponsor partners in README across all languages.

## [3.12.3] - 2026-03-24

Major release adding GitHub Copilot reverse proxy support, macOS code signing & Apple notarization, intelligent reasoning effort mapping for o-series models, skill backup/restore lifecycle, proxy gzip compression, and critical fixes for WebDAV password safety, tool message parsing, and dark mode.

**Stats**: 36 commits | 107 files changed | +9,124 insertions | -802 deletions

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot Reverse Proxy**: Full GitHub Copilot integration as a Claude Code provider via OAuth Device Code flow; includes multi-account management, automatic token refresh, Anthropic ↔ OpenAI format conversion, real-time model list fetching, and usage statistics (#930)
- **Copilot Auth Center**: New Auth Center panel in Settings for managing GitHub accounts globally, with per-provider account binding via `meta.authBinding`
- **Tool Search Toggle**: Added `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` env var support for Claude 2.1.76+; exposed as a checkbox in the provider Common Config editor (#930)
- **Reasoning Effort Mapping**: Two-tier `resolve_reasoning_effort()` for OpenAI o-series and GPT-5+ models — explicit `output_config.effort` takes priority, falling back to thinking `budget_tokens` thresholds (<4 000→low, 4 000–16 000→medium, ≥16 000→high); covers both Chat Completions and Responses API paths with 17 unit tests
- **OpenCode SQLite Backend**: Added SQLite session storage support for OpenCode alongside existing JSON backend; dual-backend scan with SQLite priority on ID conflicts, atomic session deletion, and path validation (#1401)
- **Skill Auto-Backup**: Skill files are automatically backed up to `~/.cc-switch/skill-backups/` before uninstall, with metadata preserved in `meta.json`; old backups pruned to keep at most 20
- **Skill Backup Restore & Delete**: Added list/restore/delete commands for skill backups; restore copies files back to SSOT, saves the DB record, and syncs to the current app with rollback on failure
- **macOS Code Signing & Notarization**: CI now imports an Apple Developer ID certificate, signs the universal binary, submits for Apple notarization, and staples the ticket to both `.app` and `.dmg`; a hard-fail verification step (`codesign --verify` + `spctl -a` + `stapler validate`) gates the release for both artifacts
- **Codex 1M Context Window Toggle**: One-click checkbox in Codex config editor to set `model_context_window = 1000000` with auto-populated `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 900000`; unchecking removes both fields
- **Disable Auto-Upgrade Toggle**: Added `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` env var checkbox in the Claude Common Config editor to prevent Claude Code from auto-upgrading

### Changed

- **Skills Cache Strategy**: Replaced `invalidateQueries` with direct `setQueryData` updates for skill install/uninstall/import operations; added `staleTime: Infinity` with `keepPreviousData` to eliminate loading flicker (#1573)
- **Proxy Gzip Compression**: Non-streaming proxy requests now auto-negotiate gzip compression instead of forcing `identity`; streaming requests conservatively keep `identity` to avoid SSE decompression errors
- **o1/o3 Model Compatibility**: Chat Completions proxy forwarding now correctly uses `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens` for OpenAI o-series models such as o1/o3/o4-mini (#1451)
- **OpenCode Model Variants**: Placed OpenCode model variants at top level instead of inside options for better discoverability (#1317)
- **Skills Import Flow**: Replaced implicit filesystem-based app inference with explicit `ImportSkillSelection` to prevent incorrect multi-app activation; added reconciliation to remove disabled/orphaned symlinks and MCP servers from live config
- **Claude 4.6 Context Window**: Updated Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 context window from 200K to 1M across OpenClaw and OpenCode presets (GA release)
- **MiniMax Model Upgrade**: Updated MiniMax presets from M2.5 to M2.7 across Claude, OpenClaw, and OpenCode configurations with updated partner descriptions in all three locales
- **Xiaomi MiMo Model Upgrade**: Updated MiMo presets from mimo-v2-flash to mimo-v2-pro across all supported applications
- **AddProviderDialog Simplification**: Removed redundant OAuth tab, reducing dialog from 3 tabs to 2 (app-specific + universal)
- **Provider Form Advanced Options Collapse**: Model mapping, API format, and other advanced fields in the Claude provider form now auto-collapse when empty; auto-expands when any value is set or when a preset fills them in

### Fixed

- **WebDAV Password Silent Clear**: Fixed WebDAV password being silently wiped when ProviderList or UsageScriptModal saved settings by stripping `webdavSync` from frontend payloads and adding backend backfill logic in `merge_settings_for_save()` to preserve existing passwords
- **Tool Message Parsing**: Fixed tool_use/tool_result message classification across Claude (tool_result content blocks), Codex (function_call/function_call_output payloads), and Gemini (array content + toolCalls extraction) session providers (#1401)
- **Dark Mode Selector**: Changed Tailwind `darkMode` from `["selector", "class"]` to `["selector", ".dark"]` to ensure correct dark mode activation (#1596)
- **Copilot Request Fingerprint**: Unified Copilot request fingerprint headers across all API call sites to prevent User-Agent leakage and stream check mismatches
- **o-series Responses API Tokens**: Kept Responses API on the correct `max_output_tokens` field for o-series models instead of incorrectly injecting `max_completion_tokens`
- **Provider Form Double Submit**: Prevented duplicate submissions on rapid button clicks in provider add/edit forms (#1352)
- **Ghostty Session Restore**: Fixed Claude session restore in Ghostty terminal (#1506)
- **Skill ZIP Import Extension**: Added `.skill` file extension support in ZIP import dialog (#1240, #1455)
- **Skill ZIP Install Target App**: ZIP skill installs now use the currently active app instead of always defaulting to Claude
- **OpenClaw Active Card Highlight**: Fixed active OpenClaw provider card not being highlighted (#1419)
- **Responsive Layout with TOC**: Improved responsive design when TOC title exists (#1491)
- **Import Skills Dialog White Screen**: Added missing TooltipProvider in ImportSkillsDialog to prevent runtime crash when opening the dialog
- **Panel Bottom Blank Area**: Replaced hardcoded `h-[calc(100vh-8rem)]` with `flex-1 min-h-0` across all content panels to eliminate bottom gap caused by mismatched offset values

### Docs

- **Pricing Model ID Normalization**: Added documentation section explaining model ID normalization rules (prefix stripping, suffix trimming, `@`→`-` replacement) in EN/ZH/JA user manuals (#1591)
- **macOS Signed & Notarized**: Removed all `xattr` workaround instructions and "unidentified developer" warnings from README, README_ZH, installation guides (EN/ZH/JA), and FAQ pages (EN/ZH/JA); replaced with "signed and notarized by Apple" messaging

## [3.12.2] - 2026-03-12

Post-v3.12.1 work focuses on Common Config safety during proxy takeover and more reliable Codex TOML editing.

**Stats**: 5 commits | 22 files changed | +1,716 insertions | -288 deletions

### Added

- **Empty State Guidance**: Improved first-run experience with detailed import instructions and a conditional Common Config snippet hint for Claude/Codex/Gemini providers

### Changed

- **Proxy Takeover Restore Flow**: Proxy takeover hot-switch and provider sync now refresh the restore backup instead of overwriting live config files, rebuilding effective provider settings with Common Config applied so rollback preserves the real user configuration
- **Codex TOML Editing Engine**: Refactored Codex `config.toml` updates onto shared section-aware TOML helpers in Rust and TypeScript, covering `base_url` and `model` field edits across provider forms and takeover cleanup
- **Common Config Initialization Lifecycle**: Startup now auto-extracts Common Config snippets from clean live configs before takeover restoration, tracks explicit "snippet cleared" state, and persists a one-time legacy migration flag to avoid repeated backfills

### Fixed

- **Common Config Loss During Takeover**: Fixed cases where proxy takeover could drop Common Config changes, overwrite live configs during sync, or produce incomplete restore snapshots when switching providers
- **Codex Restore Snapshot Preservation**: Fixed Codex takeover restore backups so existing `mcp_servers` blocks survive provider hot-switches instead of being discarded; changed MCP backup preservation from wholesale table replacement to per-server-id merge so provider/common-config MCP updates win on conflict while live-only servers are retained
- **Cleared Snippet Resurrection**: Fixed startup auto-extraction recreating Common Config snippets that users had intentionally cleared
- **Codex `base_url` Misplacement**: Fixed Codex `base_url` extraction and editing to target the active `[model_providers.<name>]` section instead of appending to the file tail or confusing `mcp_servers.*.base_url` entries for provider endpoints

- **Common Config Runtime Overlay**: Common Config is now applied as a runtime overlay during provider switching instead of being materialized (merged) into each provider's stored config. This preserves the original provider config in the database and applies common settings dynamically at write time
- **First-Run Auto-Extract**: On first run, Common Config Snippets are automatically extracted from the current live configuration files, eliminating the need for manual initial setup

### Fixed

#### Proxy & Streaming

## [3.11.1] - 2026-02-28

### Hotfix Release

This release reverts the Partial Key-Field Merging architecture introduced in v3.11.0, restoring the proven "full config overwrite + Common Config Snippet" mechanism, and fixes several UI and platform compatibility issues.

**Stats**: 8 commits | 52 files changed | +3,948 insertions | -1,411 deletions

### Reverted

- **Restore Full Config Overwrite + Common Config Snippet** (revert 992dda5c): Reverted the partial key-field merging refactoring from v3.11.0 due to critical issues — non-whitelisted custom fields were lost during provider switching, backfill permanently stripped non-key fields from the database, and the whitelist required constant maintenance. Restores full config snapshot write, Common Config Snippet UI and backend commands, and 6 frontend components/hooks

### Changed

- **Proxy Panel Layout**: Moved proxy on/off toggle from accordion header into panel content area, placed directly above app takeover options, ensuring users see takeover configuration immediately after enabling the proxy
- **Manual Import for OpenCode/OpenClaw**: Removed auto-import on startup; empty state now shows an "Import Current Config" button, consistent with Claude/Codex/Gemini behavior

### Fixed

- **"Follow System" Theme Not Auto-Updating**: Delegated to Tauri's native theme tracking (`set_window_theme(None)`) so the WebView's `prefers-color-scheme` media query stays in sync with OS theme changes
- **Compact Mode Cannot Exit**: Restored `flex-1` on `toolbarRef` so `useAutoCompact`'s exit condition triggers correctly based on available width instead of content width
- **Proxy Takeover Toast Shows {{app}}**: Added missing `app` interpolation parameter to i18next `t()` calls for proxy takeover enabled/disabled messages
- **Windows Protocol Handler Side Effects**: Disabled environment check and one-click install on Windows to prevent unintended protocol handler registration

---

## [3.11.0] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

#### Architecture

- **Partial Key-Field Merging (⚠️ Breaking, reverted in v3.11.1)**: Provider switching now uses partial key-field merging instead of full config overwrite, preserving user's non-provider settings (plugins, MCP, permissions). The "Common Config Snippet" feature has been removed as it is no longer needed. Removes 6 frontend files and ~150 lines of backend dead code (#1098)
- **Manual Import**: Replaced auto-import on startup with manual “Import Current Config” button in empty state, reducing ~47 lines of startup code
- **OMO Variant Parameterization**: Eliminated ~250 lines of OMO/OMO Slim code duplication via `OmoVariant` struct with STANDARD/SLIM constants
- **OMO Common Config Removal**: Removed the two-layer merge system for OMO common config (-1,733 lines across 21 files)

#### Code Quality

- **ProviderForm Decomposition**: Extracted ProviderForm.tsx from 2,227 lines to 1,526 lines by splitting into 5 focused modules (opencodeFormUtils, useOmoModelSource, useOpencodeFormState, useOmoDraftState, useOpenclawFormState)
- **Shared MCP/Skills Components**: Extracted AppCountBar, AppToggleGroup, and ListItemRow shared components to eliminate duplication across MCP and Skills panels
- **OpenClaw TanStack Query Migration**: Migrated Env, Tools, and AgentsDefaults panels from manual useState/useEffect to centralized TanStack Query hooks

#### Settings Layout

- **Proxy Tab**: Split Advanced tab into dedicated Proxy tab (local proxy, failover, rectifiers, global outbound proxy); moved pricing config to Usage dashboard as collapsible accordion. SettingsPage reduced from ~716 to ~426 lines with 5-tab layout: General | Proxy | Advanced | Usage | About
- **Data Section Split**: Split data accordion into Import/Export and Cloud Sync sections for better discoverability

#### Terminal & Config

- **Unified Terminal Selection**: Consolidated terminal preference to global settings; added WezTerm support and terminal name mapping (iterm2 → iterm)
- **OpenClaw Agents Panel**: Primary model field set to read-only; detailed model fields (context window, max tokens, reasoning, cost) moved to advanced options
- **Claude Model Update**: Updated Claude model references from 4.5 to 4.6 across all provider presets

### Fixed

#### Critical

- **Windows Home Dir Regression**: Restored default home directory resolution on Windows to prevent providers/settings “disappearing” when `HOME` env var differs from the real user profile directory (Git/MSYS environments); auto-detects v3.10.3 legacy database location
- **Linux White Screen**: Disabled WebKitGTK hardware acceleration on AMD GPUs (Cezanne/Radeon Vega) to prevent EGL initialization failure causing blank screen on startup
- **OpenAI Beta Parameter**: Stopped appending `?beta=true` to OpenAI Chat Completions endpoints, fixing request failures for Nvidia and other `apiFormat=”openai_chat”` providers
- **Health Check Auth Mode**: Health check now respects provider's auth_mode setting instead of always using x-api-key header

#### Provider & Preset

- **OpenClaw /v1 Prefix**: Removed /v1 prefix from OpenClaw anthropic-messages presets to prevent double path (/v1/v1/messages) with Anthropic SDK auto-append
- **Opus Pricing**: Corrected Opus pricing from $15/$75 to $5/$25 and upgraded model ID to claude-opus-4-6
- **AIGoCode URLs**: Unified API base URL to https://api.aigocode.com across all apps; removed trailing /v1 suffix
- **Zhipu GLM**: Removed outdated partner status from Claude, OpenCode, and OpenClaw presets
- **API Key Visibility**: Restored API Key input field when creating new Claude providers (was incorrectly hidden for non-cloud_provider categories)

#### OMO / OMO Slim

- **OMO Slim Category Checks**: Added missing omo-slim category checks across add/form/mutation paths
- **OMO Slim Cache Invalidation**: Invalidate OMO Slim query cache after provider mutations to prevent stale UI state
- **OMO Recommended Models**: Synced agent/category recommended models with upstream sources; fixed provider/model format to pure model IDs
- **OMO Fill Feedback**: Added toast feedback when “Fill Recommended” button silently fails
- **OMO Last-Provider Restriction**: Removed last-provider deletion restriction for OMO/OMO Slim plugins
- **OpenCode Model Validation**: Reject saving OpenCode providers without at least one configured model

#### OpenClaw

- **OpenClaw P0-P3 Fixes**: Fixed 25 missing i18n keys, replaced key={index} with stable crypto.randomUUID(), excluded openclaw from ProxyToggle/FailoverToggle, added deep link merge_additive_config(), unified serde(flatten) naming, added directory existence checks, removed dead code, added duplicate key validation
- **OpenClaw Robustness**: Fixed EnvPanel visibleKeys using entry key names instead of array indices; added NaN guards; validated provider ID and model before import
- **OpenClaw i18n Dedup**: Merged duplicate openclaw i18n keys to restore provider form translations

#### Platform

- **Window Flash**: Prevented window flicker on silent startup (Windows)
- **Title Bar Theme**: Title bar now follows dark/light mode theme changes
- **Skills Path Separator**: Fixed path separator matching for skill installation status on Windows (supports both `/` and `\`)
- **WSL Conditional Compilation**: Added `#[cfg(target_os = “windows”)]` to WSL helper functions to eliminate dead_code warnings on non-Windows platforms

#### UI

- **Toolbar Clipping**: Removed toolbar height limit that was clipping AppSwitcher
- **Update Badge**: Show update badge instead of green check when a newer version is available
- **Session Button Visibility**: Only show Session Manager button for Claude and Codex apps
- **Directory Spacing**: Added vertical spacing between directory setting sections
- **Dark Mode Cards**: Unified SQL import/export card styling in dark mode
- **OpenClaw Scroll**: Enabled scrolling for OpenClaw configuration panel content

#### i18n & Localization

- **Session Manager i18n**: Replaced hardcoded Chinese strings with i18n keys for relative time, role labels, and UI elements
- **OpenClaw Default Model Label**: Renamed “Enable/Default” to “Set as Default / Current Default” with wider button
- **Daily Memory Sort**: Sort daily memory files by filename date (YYYY-MM-DD.md) instead of modification time
- **Backup Name i18n**: Use local time for backup file names

#### Other

- **Skill Doc URL**: Use actual branch from download_repo for documentation URL; switched from /tree/ to /blob/ pointing to SKILL.md
- **OpenCode Install Detection**: Added install.sh priority paths (OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR > XDG_BIN_DIR > ~/bin > ~/.opencode/bin) with path dedup and cross-platform executable candidates
- **Provider Auto-Import**: Removed auto-import side effect from useProvidersQuery queryFn; users now trigger import manually via empty state button
- **Manual Backup Validation**: Treat missing database file as error during manual backup to prevent false success toast

### Performance

- **Session Panel Loading**: Parallel directory scanning and head-tail JSONL reading for Codex, OpenClaw, and OpenCode session providers
- **Query Cache Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary TanStack Query cache overhead for Tauri local IPC calls

### Documentation

- **Sponsors**: Added/updated SSSAiCode, Crazyrouter, AICoding, Right Code, and MiniMax sponsor entries across all README languages
